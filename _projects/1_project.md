PlanYourMeals was a passion project that grew out of a frustration with existing calorie trackers like MyFitnessPal and the automatic meal planner EatThisMuch. Like so many people, my early efforts going to gym were limited until that realization that diet is 80% of success. The bottom line? Muscles grow much easier in the precesnse of a caloric surplus and fat only disappears in the precense of a deficit. Working out with controlling eating leads to a lot of effort with marginly noticeable results. 

Originally, I used MyFitnessPal to track calories, but could rarely get a perfect macro fit. Often, I'd find myself desperately trying to find a source of protein for dinner after 'spending' too many carbs and fats at breakfast and lunch. I tried a 


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
