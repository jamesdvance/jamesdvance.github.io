# MLOps As Competitive Advantage

## Intro

Why Do So many companies hire ML Platform Engineers, when all the major cloud providers offer an ML Platform, a major open source platform exists, and dozens of SaaS companies offer the same thing? Because 

### Knowledge is Becoming Commodotized. Process Wins

### The Holy Iteration Cycle
* Anything that takes scientists out of the iteration cycle is wasted
* Recreating features, pulling data, writing evaluation code is all undifferentiated work
* The more scientists have to build, the more things go wrong
* Think like a scientist to understand what to abstract and what to let them modify

### What Should Be Automated and What Shouldn't Varies By Problem Case
* A tabular ML business problem might have a very limited 
* A Language Model training might need an efficient process to make and version changes to massive text datasets
* A reinforcement learning problem might need particularly efficient simulation process, available to many scientists
* A computer vision dataset may need different versions of labels
