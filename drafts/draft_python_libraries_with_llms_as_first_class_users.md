# Python Libraries With LLMs as First Class Users

* Interleave documentation - write it first
* Leave nothing non-obvious. The code is no longer the comments. 
* Explicitly and simply decribe the logic and reasoning.
* Follow the same format across all documentation
* Include an LLM.md in the beginning that describes suggested tools
