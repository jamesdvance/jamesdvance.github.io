# Leadership: Reacting Less To Turbulance And Difficulty

### Outline
Leadership is about is about keeping a group moving in the right direction. If your business immediately cuts its daring project at the first sight of economic trouble, it never had conviction that the project was part of its core direction. 
That's what makes a true leader. Anyone can  listen to the current problems and select the least damagin solution of them to maximize a short term payoff. 
It's far harder to plant one's feet and accept the riducule and disbelief and sheer risk of failure by taking on the short-term riskier solution to get the group towards the best place in the long run. 
That's leadership. It's hard, it's stressful and it requires making moves no one will understand or appreciate until a far distant future. But reacting too much to the present isn't leadership. 

This goes for impact more generally (think Geoffery Hinton perservering through not one but two AI Winters)
