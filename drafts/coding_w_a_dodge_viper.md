## Taming the Beast

Using Cursor, Cline, and Claude code today have a feeling like barely 
AI gives you higher velocity, but requires 5x discipline. You need to test more often, mark your trail more clearly, and have fast offramps. You have to commit to your direction, not let the AI guide you. The purpose, abstractions and format of the code must remain firmly in your control. 

## Quality vs Velocity
Recently, I've been involved in a project in my job exposed me to a different use case for AI assistants: Increasing code quality instead of code velocity. This is a worthy goal, but is not a natural direction for a tool that spits out decent-looking code in seconds. Our natural instinct is to try to shape that code into something that works and move on to the next task. This serves our id (immediately succeeding in our tasks) and our ego (we are the guider and the quality judge). But LLM's most-likely-word prediction can provide very thoughtful code critiques, especially given the right context for your project. A frustration I commonly have felt in my coding journey is attempting something naively, experiencing a bug, and slowly coming up with a solution through trial and error only to later stumble upon a StackOverflow post where I learn I had derived a well-known best practice from first principles. LLMs should be brining the light to our work, not letting us stumble further into the dark. 

## Crafting Useful Tools

> It's a poor workman who blames his tools
English proverb

Right now, AI code tools have the exhuberance of a college freshman with a fake ID. Instant code generation. Interview cheat aides. Code-by-vibes. What we don't have is an IDE that makes me pause and think, when I'd normally blunder forward into a bad pattern. Instead of a Jr coder at my fingertips, I want the graybeard Sr Engineer who makes a biting critique that sticks in my head for hours until I finalize appreciate the truth in it. LLMs should be working in the background to challenge my choices, not to pour jetfuel on them.
