An ML Engineer will frequently get quizzed on python programming and data structures and algorithms. Astute interviewers will ask about Docker, infrastructure-as-code and the ML lifecyle. 

But there are several very under-discussed skills for a machine learning engineer.


### 1. Networking

### 2. Cloud Security

### 3. Data Privacy

### 4. CICD 

### 5. Data Engineering
MLOps is an extension of data engineering (link to blog saying ml engineering is data engineering).

## The 5 Most Underrated Skills Every ML Engineer Needs (But Nobody Talks About)
You've mastered Python. Your algorithm game is strong. You can explain transformers in your sleep and debug Docker containers with your eyes closed. But if you're an ML engineer in 2025, there's a harsh reality: the skills that get you hired aren't always the ones that make you successful.
While everyone obsesses over the latest model architectures and optimization techniques, the engineers who truly excel have quietly mastered a different set of skills. These are the competencies that separate those who build proof-of-concepts from those who deploy systems that serve millions of users without breaking a sweat.

### 1. Networking: Because Your Model Doesn't Live in a Vacuum
Here's what they don't tell you in ML courses: that beautifully trained model of yours needs to communicate with the outside world. And when it does, networking knowledge becomes your superpower.
Understanding load balancers, CDNs, and API gateways isn't just "nice to have" – it's essential when your inference service starts timing out under load. Can you diagnose why your model serving latency spikes during peak hours? Do you know how to configure health checks that actually reflect your service's availability? When your model needs to fetch features from multiple microservices, networking expertise transforms from obscure knowledge to critical skill.
The best ML engineers understand concepts like connection pooling, request routing, and network protocols. They know why gRPC might be better than REST for certain use cases, and they can debug distributed tracing logs when requests mysteriously disappear into the ether.

### 2. Cloud Security: Your Model is Only as Good as Its Weakest Permission
Data breaches don't just happen to "other companies." In the world of ML, where models train on sensitive data and serve predictions that influence real decisions, security isn't optional – it's fundamental.
Yet most ML engineers treat security as someone else's problem. Big mistake. Understanding IAM roles, network security groups, and encryption at rest versus in transit directly impacts your ability to build trustworthy systems. Can you explain why your training data should be encrypted with customer-managed keys? Do you know how to implement proper secret rotation for your model endpoints?
The engineers who thrive understand principle of least privilege, can spot overly permissive S3 bucket policies, and know how to secure model artifacts throughout their lifecycle. They're the ones who prevent headlines about leaked training data or compromised inference endpoints.

### 3. Data Privacy: The Invisible Requirement That Can Sink Your Project
GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA – these aren't just compliance checkboxes. They're fundamental constraints that shape how you architect ML systems. The best engineers bake privacy into their workflows from day one.
This means understanding differential privacy, knowing when to use federated learning, and being able to implement proper data retention policies. It's about building systems that can honor deletion requests without retraining models from scratch. Can you explain how to handle PII in your feature stores? Do you know how to audit your models for privacy leaks?
Privacy-aware ML engineers design systems that anonymize data at ingestion, implement proper access controls throughout the pipeline, and can demonstrate compliance without sacrificing model performance. They're the ones who sleep soundly knowing their systems won't become the next privacy scandal.

### 4. CI/CD: Because "It Works on My Machine" Isn't a Deployment Strategy
Every engineer knows about CI/CD in theory. But ML brings unique challenges that transform standard deployment practices into complex orchestrations. Model versioning, data versioning, experiment tracking, and rollback strategies – these aren't just DevOps concerns, they're core to your job.
Can you automatically trigger retraining when data drift exceeds thresholds? Do you know how to implement canary deployments for models? What about A/B testing infrastructure that can handle different model versions simultaneously? The engineers who excel can build pipelines that validate model performance, check for bias, and ensure reproducibility before any model sees production traffic.
They understand that ML CI/CD isn't just about running unit tests – it's about automating the entire lifecycle from data validation through model monitoring. They're the ones whose models deploy smoothly at 3 AM without anyone losing sleep.

### 5. Data Engineering: The Foundation Everything Else Builds On
Here's an uncomfortable truth: MLOps is really just data engineering with extra steps. Machine learning engineering is data engineering at its core, and the sooner you accept this, the better engineer you'll become.
The most effective ML engineers think like data engineers first. The optimal mlops strategy is downstream from the velocity and volume of your data. Likewise, while model performance optimization is 
This means being fluent in technologies like Apache Spark, understanding data lake architectures, and knowing how to build reliable ETL pipelines. It's about designing feature stores that can serve both training and inference workloads efficiently. The engineers who master data engineering build ML systems that scale gracefully and fail gracefully.

### The Bottom Line
Technical interviews will continue to quiz you on binary trees and gradient descent. That's fine – those fundamentals matter. But the engineers who build systems that actually work in production have moved beyond the textbook skills.
They've embraced the unglamorous but essential competencies that turn ML experiments into reliable products. They understand that a model is just one component in a complex system, and that system is only as strong as its weakest link.
The good news? These skills are learnable. The better news? Most of your competition is still focused on achieving marginally better accuracy scores while ignoring the infrastructure that makes those models useful.
So while others debate the latest architectural innovations, you can be building the robust, secure, and scalable systems that actually make it to production. Because in the end, the best model is the one that reliably serves predictions to real users – everything else is just academic.
