### Faster ML: Speeding Up Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the task of extracting text from images. It's useful in processing documents, parsing screenshots, and reading roadsigns. Because the evaluation is straightforward and well-benchmarked, its also a good class of problems to practice speeding up model inference. In this post we'll explore options for speeding up an OCR model 'EasyOCR' and weigh the time committment, speedup improvement and model performance trade-offs.
