Because of context constraints, RAG applications are critical to providing agents with the best context to complete their task. But the similarity search underlying RAG is far from perfect. Two chunks of text can be embedded similarly but still provide far different meanings:</p> <p>“The function will sort the user data by timestamp before displaying it.”</p> <p>vs</p> <p>“The function will store the user data by timestamp before displaying it.”</p> <p>At a high-level our re-ranker fits into this simple RAG chatbot: <img src="rerankers/RAG_Reranker.drawio.png"/></p> <h2 id="shifting-from-recall-to-precision">Shifting From Recall To Precision</h2> <p>The embeddings similarity search focuses on Recall - its goal is to maximize the largest percentage of the total number of relevant chunks in the database that are returned. In simpler terms, it wishes to maximize the True Positives. The re-ranker conversely optimizes for precision. Of the results returned to the agent, the re-ranker wants to maximize the % that are relevant. It aims to minimize False Positives. In doing so, re-rankers are critical to ensuring agents avoid unnecessary noise and <a href="https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot">context rot</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-downsides">The Downsides</h2> <p>Before diving into implementation, let’s acknowledge some risks associated with adding a re-ranking function. First, re-rankers add substantial latency to the RAG application. The initial vector search can be optimized down to a single-millisecond operation. On the other hand, re-ranking models (especially the ones we explore below) can take in the 100’s of ms up to several seconds. Additionally, if using re-ranker LLMs or even hosting a Cross-Encoder mentioned below, cost-per-query rises dramatically with a reranker included. For many applications, getting more precise results is worth the extra cost - and there are mitigation techniques as well. For instance, re-rankers can ‘cascade’ from fast/cheap to filter the intial results down and then ‘slow/expensive’ used to groom the final list.</p> <h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2> <p>To train and optimize a re-ranker requires a ranking dataset. A pairwise ranking dataset (1 query 1 answer) is the simplest to generate so we’ll focus on that here.</p> <h4 id="hand-labeled">Hand-Labeled</h4> <p>Hand-labeled datasets are accurate usually noise-less but who has the time?</p> <h4 id="artificially-labeled">Artificially Labeled</h4> <p>Often you can create labels for a dataset artificially, by using metadata like tags, or topic modeling to then rate ‘true’ or ‘false’ for a given search query.</p> <h4 id="llm-generated">LLM-Generated</h4> <p>LLM’s can generate a ranking datset. In the simplest way you could prompt an LLM ‘give me a search query that would result in this item’. But in more sophisticated use cases, we would provide the LLM with categories, tags and any other topic metadata for it to make a relevant but somewhat vaque query.</p> <h4 id="application-generated">Application-Generated</h4> <p>In a real-world application, re-ranking datasets can be generated from production data. In a RAG use case, we can retroactively label a results’ relevance by checking whether it was actioned on by an agent (in a purely agentic workflow) or mentioned by the user in a subsequent query (in the case of a chatbot).</p> <h2 id="common-models">Common Models</h2> <h3 id="cross-encoder">Cross-Encoder</h3> <p>A highly common model used in re-ranking tasks for RAG is the Cross Encoder.

It struck me the extento which the role is distinct role from the Sr, not that they are execute a Sr’s functions all the better. In this post I’m using ‘Principal’ based on the role’s level at Amazon. Other companies may call it Staff, or Sr Staff, but you will recognize it when you see it. It’s the top dawg on the technical reporting chain.</p> <h2 id="what-needs-to-be-done">What Needs To Be Done?</h2> <p>Sr. Engineers are trusted to lead designs. They pull off the <em>how</em>. Principal Engineers don’t add a lot of value by designing things better - the Sr Engineer’s designs should already be up to snuff. But Principal Engineers dig deep into <em>why the hell are we doing this particular task!?</em> <em>Does it really need to be done to accomplish the goal</em> ? <em>Can this step be simplified?</em> <em>Can it be removed?</em> Principals keep Srs from reinventing things and from choosing suboptimal tools from an org’s perspective. Even if its beened signed off on by various stakeholders, engineering managers, and cross-team collaborators, a Principal Eng can come in and question your project’s objective, your tools, timelines, and often your sanity.</p> <h2 id="are-you-sure-you-arent-wrong">Are You Sure You Aren’t Wrong?</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/seraph-matrix-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/seraph-matrix-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/seraph-matrix-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/seraph-matrix.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Your manager may question your methods, but they’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Over the weeks and months they’ve seen your work and heard your status updates. They trust that you’ll ultimately deliver and don’t spend too much time nit-picking your decisions. A Principal Engineer gives you no such quarter. They ruthlessly question your timeline estimates, your project plans, whether you have thought enough about security, scaling,reliability, and whether you have sufficient test coverage. To err is human, and a PE’s job is save you from this natural inclination.</p> <h2 id="isnt-this-a-pms-job">Isn’t This A PM’s Job?</h2> <p>A Principal Engineer and a Product Manager both have a main goal of making a project succeed. But the PE brings a technical perspective. They can challenge your estimates from a position of equal or superior technical knowledge as well as a superior understanding of your organization’s overall strategic approach to software. A PM might question your timelines, but only a PE can refute them.</p> <h2 id="owning-the-standards">Owning The Standards</h2> <p>If your software team builds one giant application, the Principal may make the highest-level decisions on your architecture:<br/> monolith vs microservices, multi-tenant vs single, bring your own container vs managed Kubernetes, etc. If the team builds many indpendent services, he may decide its standard tooling. Either way, it’s a way different responsibility level than leading a project. Decisions must be optimal given multiple systems and sets of engineers. What’s optimal for the organization level may be may be very suboptimal for an individual project or team, and the engineers involved may strongly resent the decision. Crucially, if things are going truly wrong, there is also no room to back up and change one’s mind. A project that is on a bad path can get back on track by engineers resolving to spend a few weekends grinding to get the project back on track. The PE-level decisions offer no such possibilities. PE decisions decide sustantial time and money investments, which once made can be the difference between the end product ultimately succeeding or failing. At decision time, it’s lonely at the top.</p> <h2 id="is-isnt-personal">Is Isn’t Personal</h2> <p>Good principal engineers have backbone. They may defend a data governance policy against two separate teams who have already agreed upon granting one-time exception. They may challenge and force a reversal on a well-debated technical decison. Invariablly, if you are an engineer making consequential decisions, the PE will outright annoy you at some point. But if they never make you unhappy or uncomfortable, they aren’t an effective Principal.</p> <h2 id="building-this-skill">Building This Skill</h2> <p>A lot of us got into tech for the love of puzzles, the thrill of finding things out, and the commradarie of building things. A good PE experiences little of that. He spends most of his time above the weeds, doesn’t stay on a single project, and frequently pisses off engineering managers and Sr Engineers. Yet, if you want to make the biggest technical impact you can, you must develop this separate set of skills. <u>The Staff Engineer's Guide</u> by Tanya Reilly is a good resource to explore the role in depth. But to fully understand their purpose it helps to experience a challenge from a Principal Engineer in your own work. Because as Seraph says in <u>The Matrix Reloaded</u>:</p> <blockquote> <p>You Never Really Know A Man Until You Fight Him - Seraph</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="career"/><category term="career,"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding the Role]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">80/20 MLOps</title><link href="https://jamesdvance.github.io/blog/2024/80_20_MLOPS/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="80/20 MLOps"/><published>2024-12-02T13:11:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-02T13:11:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jamesdvance.github.io/blog/2024/80_20_MLOPS</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jamesdvance.github.io/blog/2024/80_20_MLOPS/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="8020-mlops">80/20 MLOps</h2> <p>You need to spin up an MLOps solution for a new team. Without deepy knowing the problem area, their budget or the software development cycle of this team, what solution could one recommend to have any team up and going quickly without spending needlessly and while maintaining evolveability of the platform down the line?</p> <p>In this post, we’ll learn why a Kubeflow solution is the right starting point for 80% of ML platform use cases, why it saves on cost and how it allows teams to evolve their platform with their individual needs. Finally, we’ll setup a multi-user science experimentation and productionization platform in 20 minutes on both AWS and Google Cloud.</p> <h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3> <p>Fully managed MLOps platforms like Neptune.ai, <a href="https://domino.ai/">Domino Data Labs</a>, H2O.ai, or Platform As A Service (PaaS) options like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/">Sagemaker Studio</a> and AzureAI bring lower setup times, less maintenance, and conventinent integration. However, as we’ll explore below, a self-managed solution running on Kubernetes brings enormous flexibility and cost improvements.</p> <h2 id="key-functional-requirements">Key Functional Requirements</h2> <h3 id="requirement-1-iteration">Requirement 1: Iteration</h3> <p>This graphic of the CRISP cycle has been around since before the invention of the transformer, but the core rules still apply. Whether you’re training a robot, ML is about experimentation, learning from the results, and iterating again as quickly and cheaply as possible.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/crisp_cycle-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/crisp_cycle-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/crisp_cycle-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/crisp_cycle.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>But when machine learning teams scale, the quickness of iteration is stimied by reacting to the needs of individual models and problem areas. Some models require distributed GPU clusters, others can be experimented on single CPU. Some have hard-to-configure dependency environments which must be shared seamlessly between scientists. Model serving creates another large layer of complexity, with batch vs online serving, event-driven vs response-based, and CICD requirements.</p> <h3 id="requirement-2-unified-development">Requirement 2: Unified Development</h3> <p>An ideal MLOps solution will allow teams to manage the varying components of the machine learning cycle without jumping between different interfaces and solutions. A balkanized MLOps solution suffers from disparate code repos within a project, out of sync CICD and deployment processes, and untestable (and often unsecure) handoffs across architectures. If our goal is grease the gears of the iteration cycle referenced above, disparate tools move us in the wrong direction.</p> <p>The ideal solution unifies as much of the model development cycle as possible, including ETL, experimentation, model deployment, and monitoring. This fact has been recognized by industry leaders, as shown by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-the-next-generation-of-amazon-sagemaker-the-center-for-all-your-data-analytics-and-ai/">Sagemaker Unified Studio announcement</a> in Dec 2024.</p> <h3 id="requirement-3-flexible-integration-and-experimentation">Requirement 3: Flexible Integration and Experimentation</h3> <p>ML use cases are as diverse as the different business cases and software environments they apply to. Even within a domain such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) there are infinte subdomains and unique data processing techniques, data stores and resource needs.</p> <p>For these reasons, Kubernetes[3] stands out afor its universal flexibility. Pytorch model training, distributed Ray ETLs, and inference via vLLM can all work efficiently on Kubernetes. This is a key reason why Kubernetes is widely used across top tier tech companies and AI labs. Just prior to releasing ChatGPT, OpenAI described <a href="https://openai.com/index/scaling-kubernetes-to-7500-nodes/">scaling a Kubernetes cluster to 75000 nodes</a>.</p> <h2 id="non-functional-requirement-low-cost-and-portability">Non-Functional Requirement: Low-Cost and Portability</h2> <h3 id="cost">Cost</h3> <p>Besides flexibility, Kubernetes allows one to access a lower cost-per-compute compared to more managed or Platform As A Service alternatives. For example, training a model with a p3.2xlarge instance on AWS Sagemaker costs \$3.825 per hour at time of writing. By contrast, running the same instance in an Elastic Kubernetes Engine (EKS) cluster costs \$0.3672. The Sagemaker instance costs over 10 times as much!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/sassets/img/sagemaker_training_p3_pricing-480.webp 480w,/sassets/img/sagemaker_training_p3_pricing-800.webp 800w,/sassets/img/sagemaker_training_p3_pricing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/sassets/img/sagemaker_training_p3_pricing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/eks_p3_pricing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/eks_p3_pricing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/eks_p3_pricing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/eks_p3_pricing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="portability">Portability</h3> <p>In business, dependencies are risks. A dependency on AWS PaaS means you cannot be price sensitive without high switching costs. This is especially crucial when you consider the long-term lifecycle of your business. A decision to use Neptune today means a requirement that Neptune continue fitting your needs. Likewise, it also precludes switching to new cloud competitors who offer cheaper choices (without high switching costs).</p> <h2 id="an-example-kubeflow-on-gcp">An Example: Kubeflow on GCP</h2> <h3 id="picking-an-ml-kubernetes-framework">Picking An ML Kubernetes Framework</h3> <p>Kubeflow, Metaflow, and Bodywork are potential ML Frameworks which run on Kubernetes. Kubeflow has multiple advantages. First, it is well-supported as it initially was developed Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Another strength is its thoroughness and customization. Kubeflow offers specialized Kubernetes operators [4] for Notebooks, Workflows and Schedules, Training, Model Tuning, Serving, Model registry and a central monitoring dashboard. These custom operators also provide a customization in that they allow users to device which components are necessary at a given time. This makes Kubeflow adjustable to small projects or enterprise scale, as opposed to say Metaflow which is more of an all-in-one solution meant for a large scale project. Unlike Metaflow, it is also Cloud-agnostic.</p> <h4 id="1-network--subnets">1. Network &amp; Subnets</h4> <p>Kubeflow components consist of pods (jobs, notebooks, pipeline steps) and services (microservices, load balancers) which need their own network and IP addresses. In the following terraform code, we create a network and a private subnet, with ip ranges split between pods and services. The subnet is private by default. In reality, we’ll want to add a NAT gateway to at least allow outgoing internet traffic to retreive models from Huggingface or get data. If serving a public-facing model, we’d likely want a seperate public subnet fas well.</p> <div class="language-tf highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Network for Kubeflow</span>

Kubernetes works to ensure your application matches the spec,and uses the <em>status</em> to describe how the application is actually running. That spec is defined via a config file (usually YAML) called a <em>manifest</em>. Kubernetes offers a myriad of ways to install packages. Individual Kubeflow components can be installed via the <a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests">Kubeflow manifests repository</a>. Kubeflow allows you to install the entire platform or individual components as needed. For sake of example, we’ll install the training component.

This would have ‘N choose K’ time complexity where K = 3. n!/k!(n-k)!. We never want factorials to be part of our time complexity, so we have to look for a better solution.</p> <p>Similar to 2Sum and 3Sum, we can sort the array to reduce our exploration space. After sorting, we have a setup for a two-pointer technique. A minor detail is that we need to evaluate 3 points, not two. However, similar to the 3Sum solution, we can isolate a two-sum solution quite easily. To do so, we iterate over the array and create a subarray from our iteration point to the end of the array. In that subarray, our first pointer will always be the first element of the array. The other two pointers are assigned using the two-pointer technique. One starts at the first available starting position (start + 1) and the other at the end of the array. From there, the algorithm evaluates the sum of the 3 pointers. If the sum equals the target, we can return the sum. If it is closer than our existing solution, it takes the place of our existing solution. If neither is true, then we move the two pointers closer to each other. If the current sum is less than the target, then we want our next sum to be larger than this one. So we move the first of the two pointers up by one. If the current sum is already greater than the target, then we move the last of the pointers down by one. Because the array is sorted, these conditions make our decision process straightforward. Once the first and last of the two-pointers meet, we stop the algorithm.</p> <h3 id="runtime">Runtime</h3> <p>The solution becomes O(N^2) because in worst case we iterate over the array once and for each iteration we iterate over a subset of the entire array again. It’s like a double for-loop where the second loop gets smaller each time. So technically its less than O(N^2) but for rule-of-thumb estimate, O(N^2) works fine.</p> <h3 id="steps">Steps</h3> <ol> <li>Sort the array</li> <li>Initialize the result as the sum of the first 3 elements.</li> <li>Iterate over the array. At each iteration, perform the two-pointer iteration starting at the next index and ending at the end of the array.</li> <li>Return the result if the sum of the three indexes matches the target, re-assign if the new sum is closer than the old one, or increment or decrement the two-pointer locations depending on whether our current sum is bigger or smaller than the target.</li> </ol> <h3 id="code">Code</h3> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Solution</span><span class="p">:</span>
